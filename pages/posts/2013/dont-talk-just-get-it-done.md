Or by extension the conference room or wherever it is you are continually 
preaching your stuff. 'LOL' I know I just ruined a wonderful quote. Just 
couldn't resist.  
  
I have seen this first hand on quite a number of occasions. Which conference 
won't we attend? How many motivational speeches won't we applaud? And yet we 
are always at square one. Let's collaborate on something, anything, so long as 
it isn't just talking up plans with no execution in sight.  
  
The number of amazing ideas shared in a presentation in class just got me 
wondering about this really important topic. It's my hope that the many teams 
that gave very brilliant presentations implement them.  
  
My team is getting it done. Get it done too!

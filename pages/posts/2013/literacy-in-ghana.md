_Data about the level of literacy of the people of Ghana is readily available on the web. Sadly even reputable sources like the Ghana Statistical Service (http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/edu_stats.html) fail to provide visual representation as to the actual locations especially those with an alarming rate of illiteracy. Hence my map is to bridge this gap and help volunteers as well as the government see this and act accordingly.
